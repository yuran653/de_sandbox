de_sandbox OpenVPN Server Admin Steps
=====================================

Use these steps when you add a new VPN client.

Step 1. Generate the client configuration
- Run the generation script with a unique client name:
  `./etc/generate_client_ovpn.sh client_name`
- Example: `./etc/generate_client_ovpn.sh alice_laptop`

Step 2. Transfer the .ovpn file to the client
- The script will output the path to the generated `.ovpn` file.
- Securely transfer this file to the client (e.g., via scp, sftp, or a secure sharing link).
- Do NOT send this file over unencrypted channels (email/slack) as it contains the private key.

Step 3. Client Connection
- The client should import the `.ovpn` file into their OpenVPN Connect client (Windows/macOS/Linux/Android/iOS).
- Once connected, they should be able to reach internal resources (check `nftables` rules for specific access).

Step 4. Revocation (if needed)
- To revoke a user, use the `./easyrsa revoke client_name` command in `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/` and then generate a new CRL: `./easyrsa gen-crl`.
- Copy the `crl.pem` to `/etc/openvpn/` and restart the service.
- (Note: CRL configuration might need to be added to `server.conf` if not already present).
